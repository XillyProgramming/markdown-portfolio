I have been working with **C#** to write a software for my Master's thesis in *Civil Engineering*; **Python** and **MatLab** for small problems *neural networks*, **RenPy** to develop visual novels and **Godot** for taking a peek into game development. Currently I put all of my efforts to learn more aboout C# in **Unity 3D**.
